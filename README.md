## Overview

This project extends the paper **‚ÄúThreat Modeling in Cloud Computing: A Literature Review‚Äù** by performing **quantitative benchmarks** for calculating the accuracy and practicality of threat modeling in cloud environments.

Most existing research focuses on qualitative frameworks.  
To close this gap, our work tells **how accurate and efficient semi-automated threat modeling tools are** compared to **manual human-led analysis**, using small **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** samples.

---

## Objectives
Our goal is to calculate this two primary factors:

- **Accuracy:** Measured using Precision, Recall, and F1-score of Checkov‚Äôs detections  
- **Effort:** Measured by comparing time taken for manual vs. automated analysis  

---

## Methodology ‚Äî Step by Step

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Gather IaC Samples**
- We have created 10 small Terraform and CloudFormation templates which have common AWS services like **S3, EC2, IAM, and RDS**.  
- Each file represents either a **secure** or **insecure** configuration.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Threat Analysis (Ground Truth)**
- We did a manual threat analysis for each file and combined it to **STRIDE** and **MITRE ATT&CK** categories.  
- These manual threat analysis are what made up our gold standard dataset and is captured in [`manual_analysis.csv`](manual_analysis/manual_analysis.csv).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Scanning with Checkov**
- The same IaC files were scanned using **Checkov** (by Bridgecrew).  
- Output was exported as JSON format (`checkov_raw_output.json`) and then converted into CSV (`predicted_threats.csv`).

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping Rules**
- A mapping file [`mapping_rules.csv`](auto_scan_results/mapping_rules.csv) connects:
  - **Checkov rule IDs** ‚Üí (e.g., `CKV_AWS_20`)  
  - **STRIDE Categories** ‚Üí (e.g., *Information Disclosure*)  
  - **MITRE ATT&CK IDs** ‚Üí (e.g., `T1537`)

This tells consistency between automated and manual results.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Benchmarking Accuracy**
We compared:
- Manual findings ‚Üí `manual_analysis.csv`  
- Automated findings ‚Üí `predicted_threats.csv`

**Metrics Used:**
| Metric | Formula | Meaning |
|:--------|:---------|:--------|
| **Precision** | TP / (TP + FP) | How many detected threats were correct |
| **Recall** | TP / (TP + FN) | How many true threats were detected |
| **F1-score** | 2 √ó (Precision √ó Recall) / (Precision + Recall) | Overall balance between accuracy and completeness |

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Efficiency Measurement**
| Method | Duration | Description |
|:--------|:----------|:------------|
| **Manual Analysis** | ~40 minutes | Human inspection of all 10 IaC files |
| **Checkov Scan** | ~6 seconds | Fully automated detection |

Automation offered a **drastic reduction in time**, but manual review revealed more threats.

---

## Results Summary

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|:-------|:------:|:--------------|
| **True Positives (TP)** | 5 | Detected threats correctly matched manual findings |
| **False Positives (FP)** | 0 | No incorrect detections |
| **False Negatives (FN)** | 4 | Missed context-based or subtle threats |
| **Precision** | 1.00 | Perfect detection accuracy |
| **Recall** | 0.56 | Detected ~56 % of real threats |
| **F1-score** | 0.71 | Balanced but incomplete performance |

**Interpretation:**  
Checkov is **accurate** but **not exhaustive** it identifies major misconfigurations quickly but misses contextual, behavioral, or multi-dimensional threats that require human expertise.
